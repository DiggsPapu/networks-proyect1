Open a terminal and do this:

## How to use the client?
First of all the client connects to a server of alumchat.lol using XMPP protocol.

### Sign Up
the url for this is: localhost:3030/signUp
If you want to make a new client you have to enter just the username without the @alumchat.lol so just enter that and a password and you will get the capability of signing in. If you have a user already you can click log in to go to the loggin page.

#### How to use the Add Contact && Friend Requests
Just click on the button and it will show you some input field, you just have to enter the username you want to add to your roaster, and it will send a subscription request via xmpp after you click on the submit button that showed up, then the person will have to accept it or reject it depending on what they want and it will show up in the Friend request dropdown button.

## Difficulties
During this proyect I encountered several problems, at first y tried to develop a Backend using express and nodejs, the issue with this is that it's unnecesary to do because it's a live chat app, not an application that awaits for a response like sending requests and fetching them. It needs listeners to be connected directly with the frontend, that's why at first aproach I did a docker compose because I was developing a backend but then I refactor all this to make an app to using contexts and listeners to handle the messages and all. Then another issue was to change @xmpp to Strophe.js because @xmpp was designed for backend so It didn't handle the listeners and all the stuff I wanted. Also Strophe is not that intuitive at first sight. 

## Conclusions
I didn't like this project, it's not my type to handle protocols and all these, even though it's okay to learn about all this things and have a multiple aproach to have a general learning.
